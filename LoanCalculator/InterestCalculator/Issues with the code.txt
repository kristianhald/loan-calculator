		Issues with the code
* The knowledge of how to calculate the different types is not located in the result type, 
  but in one of the components in the calculation.
  - The benefit of this is that we are able to develop in accordance with the math that the domain uses
  - The cost is that, if we need to change the calculation or use another type as one of the components,
    then we need to remove the logic from one of the components and add it to a new one, instead of just
	changing the input type.
